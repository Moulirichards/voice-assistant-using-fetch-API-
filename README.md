# voice-assistant-using-fetch-API-
API integration using python
virtual voice assistant graphical user interface (GUI) application written in Python using the tkinter library. The application allows users to interact with a virtual assistant through voice commands and receive spoken or textual responses.

Key features of the Virtual Assistant GUI:
Speech Recognition: 
Listens to user commands using speech recognition and converts them to text.
Text-to-Speech: 
Converts responses generated by the virtual assistant into spoken audio for the user.
Weather Information Retrieval: 
Fetches weather data for a specified city using an OpenWeatherMap API.
Email Sending:
Sends emails to recipients specified by the user through an SMTP server (requires configuration with the user's email credentials).
General Knowledge Question Answering: 
Attempts to answer the user's questions using Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia.
Reminders: 
Sets reminders for the user (functionality not implemented in the provided code).
Command Interface:
Allows users to interact with the virtual assistant through text commands.
Clear and Organized GUI: 
Provides a user-friendly interface with clear labels and buttons for easy interaction.
Here's a breakdown of the code structure:

Imports: The code imports necessary libraries like tkinter for GUI development, speech_recognition for speech recognition, pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, requests for making API calls (weather), smtplib for sending emails, wikipedia for knowledge search, threading for managing concurrent tasks, wolframalpha for computational knowledge queries, and other built-in libraries like datetime, json, etc.

Class Definition (VoiceAssistantGUI):
This class represents the main application logic.
It initializes the GUI window, speech recognition engine, and Wolfram Alpha client.
It defines methods for:
Creating the GUI layout with frames, labels, buttons, and a scrolled text display for conversation history.
Logging messages to the output display.
Text-to-speech functionality using pyttsx3.
Speech recognition using sr.Recognizer and handling potential exceptions.
Fetching weather information for a city using an API and OpenWeatherMap API key (replace with your own).
Sending emails using smtplib (requires configuration with the user's email and password).
Retrieving answers to general knowledge questions using Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia, handling exceptions gracefully.
Processing user commands and performing actions based on the commands (e.g., weather, email, questions, reminders).
Toggling the listening state and managing the continuous listening loop using threading.
Clearing the conversation history display.

main Function:
Creates the main application window (root).
Creates an instance of the VoiceAssistantGUI class (app).
Starts the main event loop (root.mainloop()) to listen for user interactions and run the application.
Overall, this code demonstrates a well-structured and functional virtual assistant GUI application that can interact with users through voice commands and provide various informative responses.
